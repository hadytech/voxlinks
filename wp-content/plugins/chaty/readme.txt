= The ultimate click to chat and call now button =
Are you looking for a chat button or a click to call button? Want to make it easier for your potential customers to contact you via WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or Telegram?

Chaty is the perfect chat plugin for you! With Chaty you can display a call widget, Whatsapp button, email button, SMS button, TikTok, Google Maps button, Vkontakte button, Line.me button, Viber button, and other chat widgets. Your visitors are already using their favorite chat apps, and most of them prefer to contact you using those chat apps. By using Chaty, you give your website visitors the option to chat with you even after they leave your website. Want to use our robust pro version?

= What can you do with Chaty =
Here are some classic use cases for Chaty

* Chaty VS live chat alternatives - there's a big benefit in giving your visitors the option to use the chat channels they already use. When you use "regular" live chat alternatives, your visitors must stay on your website and wait for your response. When you let your visitors chat with you using chat apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, etc, you give them the freedom of chatting with you whenever they go.
* A direct click to chat method - show your visitors the chat channels you're available at, and let them choose the method that suits them. Your website visitors are one click away from chatting with you.
* Help your website visitors navigate to your address - if you have a physical business and want your visitors to be able to navigate to you with ease, you can use our Google Maps and Waze channels.
* Click to call - show a phone icon and let your visitors click to call you. If you want to show different local phone numbers based on page URL you can use the multi widget pro feature.
* Show different chat channels for different pages  - you can use this feature to show separate widgets for different products on your website,  show different buttons based on URL for WPML or multi-language sites, display different channels for your landing pages, and more (pro feature).
* Available days and hours - show the widget only on your opening hours, and hide it when you're out of work. You can also use it to show live chat options when you're available, and other channels when you're not (pro feature).
* Launch your favorite live chat product - you can use JavaScript as one of your chat channels to launch other live chat products like Tawk.to, Tidio, Chatra, Formilla, and more.

= Testimonials =

> "Best Chat Tool I’ve Used<br>
> I’ve had to go through several chat plugins, and all of them have been a bit complicated to setup, don’t work very well, or don’t have the functionality I’m looking for. Chaty has been the only tool I’ve found to get the job done. But my favorite feature aside from how well it works, is the back-end interface. I wish more apps would consider making the backend interface as well as Premio does theirs. Kudos!"<br><br>
